### This project provides a practical introduction to networking concepts, focusing on subnetting and the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. The aim is to foster a hands-on understanding of how networks function, how to efficiently organize them using subnets, and the role of CIDR in simplifying IP address management.

### Key Points:

**Network Understanding**: Participants explore the essentials of networking, learning how devices communicate within a network.

**Subnetting Demystified**: The project introduces subnetting as a way to optimize IP address usage. Students gain practical experience in breaking down larger networks into manageable subnets.

**CIDR Made Simple**: Emphasis is placed on grasping CIDR notation, a concise way of expressing IP address ranges and subnet information. Participants learn to use CIDR for efficient network addressing.

**Hands-On Practice**: Through practical exercises, participants configure IP addresses, design subnets, and troubleshoot common networking issues.
